# Final-Year-Project - AniFinder
This is my final year university project. The idea behind the project is to educate the children about various animals and bugs they encouter in their daily lives. It is a mobile application developed in Kotlin (therefore it only works on Android phones) with a built in image classification model (developed using Python - Tensorflow).
To enhance the user experience - a Mascot was designed and animated using Adobe Illustrator and Character Animator software along with an appealing User Interface.

Technologies used:
Kotlin - User interface develoment
Adobe Character Animator and Adobe Illustrator - Mascot design and animations
Ngrok - Acts a tunnel to connect my image classification model to the GUI
Python (Tensorflow - Keras) - Image Classification model developed

Small Video Demo can be found
